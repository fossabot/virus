# Flutter Multi-Screen Practice Project

This Flutter project is designed to practice working with multiple screens, navigation, and using FontAwesome icons. It contains several screens, each showcasing a different type of content and layout. This project is suitable for those looking to improve their Flutter skills, particularly in navigation between screens, adding custom icons, and implementing drawers and footers.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following screens:
1. `main.dart`: Entry point of the app, initializes navigation and routes.
2. `homescreen.dart`: The main home screen, providing options to navigate to other screens and featuring a drawer for additional navigation.
3. `pizza.dart`: A dedicated screen for displaying pizza-related content.
4. `fries.dart`: A screen for fries content, styled with unique visuals.
5. `vegetable.dart`: Contains content focused on vegetables.
6. `facebook.dart`: Mimics a login screen for Facebook, using FontAwesome icons.
7. `twitter.dart`: Mimics a login screen for Twitter, also with FontAwesome icons.

## Features

- **Drawer Navigation**: Users can access different sections of the app through a drawer that slides in from the side, allowing for easy navigation between screens.
- **Footer with Icons**: A footer section on the home screen includes FontAwesome icons that link to different pages, enhancing the user experience and providing a familiar navigation method.

## Icon Usage

The project uses FontAwesome icons for a more visually appealing interface. The icons were downloaded and integrated into the project to enhance the user experience, particularly on the `facebook.dart` and `twitter.dart` screens, which showcase login-related icons.

## Setup

To run this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Flutter installed and set up.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.

## How to Navigate

Each screen is accessible from `homescreen.dart`. Buttons on the home screen allow navigation to `pizza.dart`, `fries.dart`, `vegetable.dart`, `facebook.dart`, and `twitter.dart` screens, demonstrating different screen types and icon usage. The drawer also provides quick access to these screens, and the footer icons serve as an additional navigation option.

## Future Plans

This project is intended for continuous improvement and additional functionality:
- Adding more complex layouts.
- Experimenting with animations.
